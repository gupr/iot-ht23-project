TODO: 
1. Expand database (15 exhibits). Add period, type and area_in_museum attributes - Theodor <br/>
2. Find a floor plan applicable to our project, then create a new floor plan divided into sections (area_in_museum) - Gustav <br/>
3. Turn the similar exhibits button into a new activity where you show the floor plan in fullscreen. The scanned exhibit should be marked as a red dot on the map (current location). Similar exhibits are also marked nodes (other color)
